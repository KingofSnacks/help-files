Training Courses will have four different options for approvals:
- No Approvals: Learner submits for training and they are enrolled (primarily online
learning)
- One Level Approval: Learner submits request for training > Supervisor approves request
and Learner is enrolled
- Second Level Approval: Learner submits request for training > Supervisor approves
request > (Training Group) Manager approves request and Learner is enrolled
- Third Level Approval: Learner submits request for training > Supervisor approves
request > (Training Group) Manager approves request > Training Specialist approves
request and Learner is enrolled (primarily in person trainings run through the Training
Section)

**Supervisors**: will need to add new Learners to their **Managed Learners** list in the Management
Dashboard (after the Go Live Date). A Learner will not be able to submit training requests until
this is done, (see Supervisor Help File). Any new Supervisor (after 4/1/2021) will need to have
the FOCUS Admin assign the role and rights to them by filling out the form. The form is
available on the FOCUS sub-page of the Training Section Intranet page or in DocuSign
https://bit.ly/3vKY1m9
- Learners should not be their own Supervisor in the system; their Supervisor should add
them as a Managed Learner (see help file for process) in their Supervisor role
Management Dashboard (not the Manager Dashboard if they also have the Training
Group Manager role).

The **Training Coordinator** role (from ETMS) is **_not_** currently part of the system/approval chain.
The Training Specialist role is one that coordinates Internal training, usually through the Training
Section.

**Required Trainings, CPT, and Learning Paths will be added to Learner Dashboards after
the FOCUS trainings in June 2021.**
### Compliance Reports
- Training Compliance Report (by Training Group) is now Enrollment History Report
- Program Compliance Report is now Program Compliance
- Learner (Training Group) Role Report will stay the same and will be rolled out soon
### CPT (Continuing Professional Training) versus Learning Paths
- Continuing Professional Training: is training that is done on a repeating cyclical basis
(e.g. quarterly / repeat interval) that will continuously repeat. Examples: quarterly qualifications for firearms or the hourly requirements for Supervisory refresher. At this
time only the FOCUS Admin can create/add this to Learners.
- Learning Paths: A set of courses that a Learner can be enrolled in together because it is
a cohesive learning experience. May be a block of required programs based on
Department or Classification requirements; most often are not on a repeat interval but
can be. At this time, FOCUS Administrators can create/add Learning Paths to Learners.
## Coming Soon

The following applications will be part of a platform that IT is developing and are not ready for
production yet:
- Parks’ Instructor Roster Entry: Course roster submission (e.g. for quarterly qualifications,
driving tests, etc.).
- Instructor Request (formerly Course Leader Requests). Until development, we will use
Outlook calendar requests with the Scheduling Assistant for an Optional to Supervisor.
- Dive Team / Diving Log Tracking
