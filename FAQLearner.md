• What is the difference between Request Credit, External Files, and Submit Proof of
Completion?
  - Request Credit:
    - this is used to request credit for a training taken externally that matches
up with a course in the Training Catalog; it will not reflect in compliance
reports if those need to be run or are required for the course
  - External Files:
    - this function allows the Learner to upload licenses, degrees, etc. This is
not to be used for training certificates or completion certificates for
training
  - Submit Proof of Completion:
    - Preferred method of adding training to your record.
- After registering for and taking a training, you may submit your
Proof of Completion using this function to have it marked as
complete and added to your training record. This is for courses
that are not managed by a Training Specialist or the Training
Section; they will add the training to your record
- How do I add external training to my record?
  - Please view the Request Credit section for the Learner Help File.
  - Learners can upload their own training certificates for external courses and their
certificate submission will be routed to their Supervisor to review/approve.
When the Supervisor approves, the system will post the certificate to the
Learner’s training record/history.
