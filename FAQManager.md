### Manager Role
Managers should reside in the Training Group of their Learners. Managers should NOT use the
Managed Learners function on the dashboard to add new Learners to their supervisory chain;
they should only use the Supervisors dashboard.
Training Group Managers (one per Training Group): Profiles (Supervisor/Training Group) should
only be updated by the FOCUS Administrators to keep integrity of the approval chain. If a
Manager of a Training Group transfers/retires/leaves, the lead Administrative Officer/person for


the Training Group needs to notify the FOCUS Administrators ASAP to update to the new
designated Manager.
If Manager/Supervisor have been assigned to the Training Group they will see ALL the Learners
in that Training Group. Supervisors will see their subordinates on the management dashboard
under the Direct reports block.
- If a Learner has the same Supervisor and Manager, who does the Training Request go
to for approval?
  - The Supervisor role will get the email and it will appear on the Supervisor’s
Management Dashboard.
  - Then the Manager role will get the email and it will appear on the Training Group
Manager’s Management Dashboard
- Where do I go to approve training?
  - As a Manager you will receive system notifications for all training requests in your
training group that need Manager level approval. You can directly review the
training request information, approve/deny/or request for more information from
the notification.
  - You can also go to your Manager– Management Dashboard to review the
training request information, approve/deny/or request for more information.
- How do I assign / proxy someone else to be the Manager?
  - This feature is COMING SOON!
